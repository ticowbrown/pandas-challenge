- PyCitySchool Analysis

- For the PyCity School Analysis, two csv files were provided give infomraion on the schools and the math and reading scores of the students.
- In order to perform the analysis, first the data needed to be combined and cleaned. This will allow for calculations to be perfomed on the data sets.
- A district summary was performed on the data to present the school's population, budget, and average scores and percentage passing for math and reading.
- Dataframe was then sorted to presnt the highest and lowest performing schools based on percentage of overall passing of both math and reading.
- A breakdown was then performed to show these scores by grade level for these schools for math and reading.
- Further analysis of the data was performed to present the results based on the per student budget, size of the school, and the school's type. 


After review of the data presented, it can be concluded that the largest schools with the higher per student budget did not result in higher percentage of students passing both the reading and math tests. 
Small and medium size schools that also had a lower budget per student had better student performaces. These schools from these two sets also charter schools, versus the larger schools that are distric schools. 
It can be assumed that the size, budget, and type of school will have an impact on student performance. While larger schools had lower percentage of overall passing of both test, this was due to lower passing rate for math. 
While the reading percentage is still not as high as the other schools sizes, this percentage is above 82%.
